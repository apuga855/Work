<!--
-When linking to other web pages within the same site you do not need to specify the absolute path. This is known as 
	using the shorthand URL or relative URL
-If all the same web pages are in the same folder then the value of the href value attribute could just be the name of
	the file
-Relative URLs skip havingn to write out the domain name since the current webpage already is within the same domain.
