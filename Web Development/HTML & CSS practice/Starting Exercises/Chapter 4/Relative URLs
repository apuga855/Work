Relative URLs
-When referencing a webpage on your website within your same domain name you do not need to type the absolute path
	of the webpage, we can use the shorthand version.
-This is specially useful when learning HTML, since you do not have to start hosting yoru website and can access
	your own webpages within the same folder
-Accessing webpages within the same folder is as easy as typing the name of the folder path plus file on the link 
	element
-There are several ways to set up the relative link:
	-Same folder: Just use the file name, <a href="reviews.html"> Reviews<a/>
	-Child folder: Use the name of the child folder followed by a forward slash, 
		<a href="music/listings.html"> Listings</a>
	-Grandchild folder: Repeat the same process for each folder traversed, 
		<a href="movies/dvd/reviews.html"> Reviews</a>
	-Parent folder: Use the "../" to indicate a folder path up followed by the file name of the page
		<a hreef="../index.html" Home</a>
	-Grandparent folder: Repeat the same process for each folder traversed, <a href="../../index.html"> Home</a>
