Directory Structure
-Directory structure is extremely important for larger sites, it helps group content and helps organize the code
-The "Top Level" directory is known as the root folder
-Higher level folders are parents of the lower level folders
-The default homepage of a site is written in HTML and is usually called index.html
-Web servers will usually return index.html as the browsing point if a request is made to a web page it doesn't 
	recognize
-Every page and every image on a website has its own URL or Uniform Resource Locator.
-The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the path name of the page or image, which is also why folder 
	structure is important when making a website
-Individual folders or individual groupings of webpages within a website should have their own index.html to navigate
	back whenever errors occur.
