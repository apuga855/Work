-The <blockquote></blockquote> element is used for longer quotes, not that it takes up an entire parragraph on its own.
	Remember you still need to use a <p></p> element inside the <blockquote></blockquote> element. 
-The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a parragraph. Browsers will usually put quotes around the 
	<q> element, but Internet Explorer does not so many people avoid it. Both elements can use the cite attribute
	to indicate where the quote is from.
