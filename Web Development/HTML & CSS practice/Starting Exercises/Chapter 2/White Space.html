-For code to be asier to read, authors will often indent and add more whitespace to their code
-When a browser comes across more than one character for white space, the browser only interprets it as a single white
	space. The same occurs with a line break, one line break and multiple line breaks are displayed as a single white
	space, this is known as WHITE SPACE COLLAPSING
