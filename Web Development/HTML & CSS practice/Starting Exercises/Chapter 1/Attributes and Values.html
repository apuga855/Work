<!--Attributes provide addiional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the 
	element an are made up of two parts:
		Part 1: The name
		Part 2: The value
	The name and value are separated by an equal sign.

The ATTRIBUTE name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be
written in lower case. 

The VALUE is the information or setting fo rthe attribute. It should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes
can and will probably have different values.

In this example, the attribute 'lang' is used to indicate the language used in this element. The value of this 
attribute ' "eng-us" '' specifies it is US English.

Most attributes can only be used on certain elements, although a few attributes like 'lang' can be used on any elements

Most values are either pre-defined or follow a stipulated format. For example, the value of the lang attribute is an 
abbreviated way of specifying whichd language is used inside the element that all browsers can understand.
