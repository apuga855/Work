Words within the angled brackets are known as HTML elements, HTML elements are usually made up of two "tags"
An opening tag is a word within the angled brackets, a closing tag is a word between the angled brackets but
also having a leading back slash. 

Example:
	Opening tag: <p> 
	Closing tag: </p>

Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags
-->
<!--This is the opening tag for an html document. The html tags indicate anything within them is html code-->
<html>
	<!--This is the body tag of the html document. The body tags indicates that anything within them should be
		in the main browser window.
	-->
	<body>
		<!--This is the main heading tag. The h1 tags indicates any text within them is the text for the main heading.
		-->
		<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
		<!--This is a paragraph tag after the main heading. 
			The paragraph tags indicates the text within them is a paragraph.
		-->
		<p>This is a paragraph after the Main Heading</p>
		<!--This is a sub heading-->
		<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
		<!--This is a parrafraph tag after the first sub heading. The h2 tags indicate anything 
			withing them is the sub heading text
		-->
		<p>This is a paragraph after the first sub heading</p>
		<!--This is another sub heading tag, just as the previous tag-->
		<h2>This is another Sub-Heading</h2>
		<!--This is another paragraph tag after the another sub heading-->
		<p>This is the paragraph after the "another sub heading"</p>
	</body>
