<!--
-Where an image is placed in the code will directly affect how it is displayed
-Before a parragraph: The parragraph starts on a new line after the image
-Inside the start of a parragraph: The first row of the text aligns with the bottom of the image
-In the middle of a parragraph: The image is placed between the words of the parragraph that it appears in
-HTML shows items in two ways: Block elements always appear on a new line (like <h1></h1> or <p></p>) and inline 
	elements which sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line (like <img src="", <b></b>>, etc)
