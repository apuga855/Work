Three rules for Creating Images
-Save images in the right format. Wrong formats make images not look good for your webpage
-Save images at the right size. Wrongly sized images appeared muddled, have blank space, are stretched/distorted, etc
-Measure images in pixes. Computer screens are made up of pixels, always measure your images on pixels so you can have a
	better idea on how your webpage will look
