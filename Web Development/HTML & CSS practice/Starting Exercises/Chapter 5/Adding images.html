<!--
-To add an image into the page we need to usre the <img src=""> element. This is an empty element, which means it does
	not have a closing tag, however, it does need to have two attributes
-The "src" attribute tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL.
-The "alt" attribute provides a text description of the image if the user cannot see the image
-The "title" attribute provides additional information about the image, most browsers display this on the tooltip when
	hovering over the image in the website
